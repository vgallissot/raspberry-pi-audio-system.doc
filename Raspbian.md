I use current stable release of Raspbian: Jessie  

You just have to install it on a SD flash card:

1. [Download latest Raspbian LITE release](https://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads/raspbian/)
2. [Follow steps to install it on your SD card](https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/installation/installing-images/linux.md)
