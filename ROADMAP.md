## Active roadmap

Current version is: v1.0.0

* v1.0: Autonomous audio system to play audio from bluetooth devices with manual pairing via command line and manual connect from bluetooth device
* v2.0: some sounds when PI is ready do connect + when connected + when disconnected
* v3.0: autopairing and autoconnect

## Nice to have
* Use PulseAudio with RTP module to stream audio to another PulseAudio device (multiroom)
* Add pushable rotor to change volume and start/stop PI
