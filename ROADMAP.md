## Active roadmap

Current version is: v2.1

* v3.0: (in progress) autopairing and autoconnect
* v2.0: Play some sounds when PI is ready to connect + when connected + when disconnected + when shutting down
* v1.0: Autonomous audio system to play audio from bluetooth devices with manual pairing via command line and manual connect from bluetooth device

## Nice to have
* Use PulseAudio with RTP module to stream audio to another PulseAudio device (multiroom)
* Add pushable rotor to change volume and start/stop PI
